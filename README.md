# Real-Estate-Marketplace-Website
The initial task was to just design a database for some scenario, I ended up making a whole website which involves buying and selling or property online, just like any other classifieds app. 
This was really a big step and a truning point for me because from this point on, I really decided which way I wanted to go as a Programmer.
